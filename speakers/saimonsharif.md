For large, mature JavaScript codebases with many contributing engineers, it’s very difficult to modernize and change large pieces of extant code. When a library you use has a breaking change, there’s a lot of work to update older, neglected pieces of code. With codemods, engineers can programmatically refactor and create project-wide code changes to modernize their applications while saving hundreds of development hours and dramatically reducing tech debt.
