At CodePen, the team&#x27;s main goal is to reduce the need for a workflow setup to quickly prototype, build, and/or show off your code. Cassidy recently built out one of the team&#x27;s latest releases: an entirely new Babel processor from scratch. In this talk, she&#x27;ll go through the reasoning behind the processor, how Babel plugins work, how the processor was added into the Pen editor, and the potential future for CodePen with that work in place.
