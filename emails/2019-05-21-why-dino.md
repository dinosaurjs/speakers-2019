# Why DinosaurJS?

DinosaurJS is part of the JSConf Family of Conferences and this will be its fourth year! We're a completely community-run conference, with no major backing other than our wonderful sponsors and ticket sales. The conference will be held at the [Studio Loft](http://www.artscomplex.com/venues/detail/studio-loft) this year.

## Content: June 20th and 21st

We have an incredible amount of content we cover each year. On day one we have a single track day of talks. On day two we have workshops from Twilio SendGrid, Workday and more to be announced! [Here are all the amazing talks](http://confreaks.tv/events/dinosaurjs2018) from the conference portion last year, and you can check out what people were saying on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dinojs?vertical=default&src=hash) about the conference. This year we have presentations ranging from data-science in the browser, to testing, to the future of packaging and animation.


## Community

We highly value diversity in our speaker line-up and in our attendees. The entire speaker selection process is blind and we have accomplished a diversity ratio of at least 50% over the past three years. We offer opportunity scholarships to people in the community who would like to come, but maybe canâ€™t afford it. The conference is all about JavaScript, but we want to have some fun too! Keeping with the theme, we encourage people to dress up, and find different ways to meet new friends.

## Letter to Work

If you need to convince your manager to allow you to attend or cover the cost of your ticket, we drafted a handy letter for you.

> Hey,
> 
> I know youâ€™re busy, so Iâ€™ll keep this brief! I know youâ€™ve invested time in me to teach me about our tech stack and applications and thatâ€™s awesome. I would like to take two days this year in June to invest in myself and make this partnership even stronger. ðŸ’ª This wonâ€™t be me spending any time on the beach, but instead packing my brain full of knowledge on JavaScript. Iâ€™d love if our company can sponsor me to attend this year. Let me tell you a bit about it:
> 
> DinosaurJS is a completely community-run conference, part of the JSConf Family of Conferences and this will be its fourth year! Itâ€™s held in Denver, Colorado on June 20th and 21st. They have one day of conference talks and one day of workshops. The day is packed with information from 8am-6pm and will be covering talks from data-science in the browser, to testing, to the future of packaging and animation. They also have built in breaks and fun activities surrounding the event so that we have a chance to meet other people from the community! 
> 
> I know that by attending this event Iâ€™ll come back to work on Monday full of ideas, new connections in the community and ready to try something new! The best part is, I can share this with colleagues afterwards with the recorded videos too. 
> 
> So, Iâ€™d like to attend and if this sounds like something you think our whole team could be into, they do group discounts for 5 or more people! Thanks for listening and I hope to have an opportunity to attend DinosaurJS this year!
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> Your JavaScript enthusiast
