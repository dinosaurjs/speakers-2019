## A thank you and invitation
We can’t believe that it’s been _three years_ since we started on this crazy adventure with all of you, “Javascript, Dinosaurs, Caffeine inhalation — conference edition”. 
We’ve learned so much since day one and each year we’re constantly trying to think of what we can do better not only for our attendees, but our speakers and our sponsors. 

We will keep this short and sweet, but as a thank you, we’d live to invite you to attend the conference this year at year one price. A little throwback Thursday action if you will. 
We are going to keep this offer open through the weekend and it’s open to you, our loyal previous attendee, only. 
Use the code “dinoalum” at checkout to see your reflected price discount.

If you can’t make it, we totally understand! But if you have any feedback on how we can make things better, we’d also like to hear about that. 💖 

Thank you for being part of our community, we deeply deeply appreciate all of your support.
