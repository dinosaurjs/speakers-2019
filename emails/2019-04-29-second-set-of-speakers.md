**Hello again friends,**

We're super excited to annouce our next set of speakers. We're going to have ten in total this year—so, this email will bring us up the halfway point.

As they say in the real estate business: "It's all about three things: location, location, location." This year, we're back at [The Studio Loft](http://www.artscomplex.com/venues/detail/studio-loft) inside of the Denver Performing Arts Center.

If this is your first year, allow us to copy and paste a description of the venue:

> The Studio Loft is an 8,000sf performance, rehearsal and event space with a cathedral ceiling, exposed brick, warm-colored walls, a 3,000sf wood dance floor, AV system with sound and high definition projector, and attached smaller room with a bar.

In our last email, we introduced [Saimon's talk on using transpilers to refactor your code at scale](https://twitter.com/dinosaur_js/status/1121848578786201600). This week, we're introducing Cassidy and her experience implementing the Babel preprocessor at [CodePen](https://codepen.io). ICYMI, We're also super excited about [Sarah's talk on the future of web animation](https://twitter.com/dinosaur_js/status/1121056197392633856).

[Rich](hjttps://twitter.com/trott) will also talk about making our tests reliable. Because maybe you're better than we are—but let us tell you what happens to unreliable tests: they get skipped.
