**Hello again friends,**

We're super excited to annouce our next set of speakers. We're going to have ten in total this yearâ€”so, this email will bring us up the halfway point.

As they say in the real estate business: "It's all about three things: location, location, location." This year, we're back at [The Studio Loft](http://www.artscomplex.com/venues/detail/studio-loft) inside of the Denver Performing Arts Center.

If this is your first year, allow us to copy and paste a description of the venue:

> The Studio Loft is an 8,000sf performance, rehearsal and event space with a cathedral ceiling, exposed brick, warm-colored walls, a 3,000sf wood dance floor, AV system with sound and high definition projector, and attached smaller room with a bar.

We'll annouce the next set of speakers along with the updated website later this week.
