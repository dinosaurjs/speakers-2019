Hey kiddos!

**Spoiler alert**: The [2019 edition of the website](https://dinosaurjs.org) is up and running. Why is this a spoiler? Mostly because it lists all of the speakers that we're planning to annouce via an excruciating series of emails and tweets. But, I guess if you have a "manager" who needs to "approve" your "expenses" then having a website helps.

To celebrate, the first ten people who use the discount code [website](https://ti.to/dinosaurjs/2019/discount/website) can get 10% off their order. You deserve to be one of those first 10 people. Be one of those first 10 people.

Anyway, we'll be updating it with the schedule and our sponsors as well and everything is going to be great.

Here are some things to be on the look out for:

- The next email will include applications for our opportunity scholarships. We're super fortunate that our sponsors allow us to provide tickets to people who could not otherwise be able to attend.
  - If you want to buy a ticket for one of our scholarship recipients, you can definitely do that [here](https://ti.to/dinosaurjs/2019/with/qf-mubwpqoe). It turns out that the **website** code will work here as well.
  - If you just want to add an additional scholarship, [you can do that as well](https://ti.to/dinosaurjs/2019/with/jv1l6xqk1cm).
- We may or may not be announcing a series of workshops for attendees.

So, anywayâ€”that's enough ranting for now. Check out our next set of amazing speakers!
