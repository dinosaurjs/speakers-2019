Firebase is Googleâ€™s mobile app development platform for iOS, Android, and mobile web developers. Firebase gives you functionality like analytics, databases, messaging and crash reporting so you can move quickly and focus on your users.  It's built on Google infrastructure and scales automatically, for even the largest apps.  Firebase products work great individually but share data and insights, so they work even better together.
